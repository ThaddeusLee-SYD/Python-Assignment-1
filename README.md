# Python-Assignment-1
This is the first assignment for Practical Python for Data Science which formed part of my Graduate Certificate in Data Science.

The objective of this project was to clean and tidy data and provide initial data exploration in Python for an employee data set. The steps and methods taken to clean and tidy the data are documented. Data exploration is also performed to see relationships between features in the data set.
